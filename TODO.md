# TODO for Slug Page Updates

- [x] Modify ClientShapePage.tsx to keep form and shapes image at top, and add affichage image and results at bottom when generated.
- [x] Add scroll-to-bottom behavior when results are generated (using window.scrollTo).
- [x] Map the slug to the affichage image path (e.g., `/affichage/${slug}-affichage.png`).
