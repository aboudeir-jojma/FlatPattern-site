# Black and White Theme Update Plan

## Information Gathered
- Site uses Tailwind CSS with various color classes (grays, blues, cyans, yellows).
- CSS variables in app/globals.css define background and foreground.
- Components have gradients and colored elements that need to be replaced with black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF).
- Grays provided (#212121, #BDBDBD, #F5F5F5) can be used for subtle transitions if needed, but prioritize pure black/white.

## Plan
1. Update CSS variables in app/globals.css to use #000000 and #FFFFFF.
2. Update app/layout.tsx: Change body background to white, text to black.
3. Update app/page.tsx: Change title gradient to solid black text.
4. Update components/Navbar.js: Replace gradients with solid black background, white text, solid black title.
5. Update components/Footer.js: Change background to black, keep white text.
6. Update components/ShapeList.js: Keep white cards, change decorative line to black, text to black.
7. Update components/ShapeForm.tsx: Change labels to black, inputs to black borders/focus, button to black with white text.
8. Update app/shape/[slug]/page.tsx: Change back button and title to black.
