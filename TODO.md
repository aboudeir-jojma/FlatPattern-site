# Task: Update Frustum Cone Form to Use Radio Buttons for H/B Selection

## Steps:
- [x] Update fields in app/shape/[slug]/page.tsx for frustum-cone to remove calc_type select.
- [x] Add radio button group in components/ShapeForm.tsx for calc_type when shapeName === "frustum-cone", before the fields map.
- [x] Set default selection to Height (H) for frustum-cone.
- [x] Test the form rendering and switching (conceptually verified; user declined runtime testing).
- [x] Update TODO.md as steps complete.
