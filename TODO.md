# TODO for UI Layout Changes in Cone Shape Page

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Step 1: Restructure the main container in `app/shape/[slug]/ClientShapePage.tsx` to have left column (form) and right column (new div wrapping image and results). Use flex-row on md screens with equal widths (w-1/2 each), gap-10.

- [x] Step 2: Move the entire `{result && (...)}` results block inside the new right column div, below the image div. Add gap-6 between image and results in the right column.

- [x] Step 3: Update the results div classes: Change p-4 to p-6, h3 to text-xl font-semibold, ul li text-sm to text-base. Add bg-white rounded-xl shadow-xl to match form style and enlarge visually.

- [x] Step 4: Fix image classes: Change "w-100 h-100 object-contain" to "w-full h-auto max-h-96 object-contain" for better responsiveness.

- [x] Step 5: Ensure mobile responsiveness: On small screens, everything stacks (flex-col), with right column stacking image > results.

- [x] Step 6: Test the changes by launching the browser at http://localhost:3000/shape/cone (assuming dev server is running) and verify the layout: form left, image+results right on desktop; enlarged results zone.

- [x] Step 7: Update TODO.md to mark all steps as completed and close the task.
